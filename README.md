# hi-hungry
Hi Hungry is a program where you answer a bunch of totally relavant questions and we find a food that we think will suit you. 
It's not your average decision maker though, it's filled with really bad dad jokes (I mean the name in itself is already one),
puns, insults, judgemental comments, and more:)
